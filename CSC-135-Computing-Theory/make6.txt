1. make6 - takes two integers, and returns a 6-digit integer constructed of the leftmost 3
digits of the first input, and the rightmost 3 digits of the second input. For example,
(make6 561432 254) would return 561254. Negative signs on either input number
should be ignored - that is, (make6 561432 -254) would also return 561254. If the first
number has less than three, and/or the second number has less than three digits, your
function should return -2. Note: you may want to define some auxiliary functions
