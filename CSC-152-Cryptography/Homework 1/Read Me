round_hash.c takes a 64bit unsigned integer 
  - converts it to little endian 
  - goes through multiple algorithms 
  - swaps back to big endian 
  - and displays the new hex code
  
  
encrypt.c must have the openssl library
  -to compile you type gcc -lcrypto hw1_openssl_encrypt.c -o encrypt
  -to execute encrypt abc123 input.txt out.bin
  -the file uses a key (abc123) and a random IV to encrypt contents of the input.txt and writes it in out.bin
  
decrypt.c must have the openssl library
  -to compile you type gcc -lcrypto hw1_openssl_decrypt.c -o decrypt
  -to execute decrypt abc123 out.bin output.txt
  -the file uses a key (abc123) and reads the IV from the encrypted file (out.bin) to decypher the encrypted contents
  -the decrypted contents is then written to output.txt
