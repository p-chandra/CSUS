  <h1>Assignment 2: Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    <b>Plugin Hybrid and Electric Vehicles Sales in the United States.<br/>
    </b>
    This dataset contains sales number of both electric and hybrid vehicles accross United States from the year 
    2011 - 2017. The dataset used is provided by the U.S. Department of Engergy. I'm interested in this topic because we
    are moving away from gas powered vehicles slowly and the following graphs I produced is a reflection of
    the rate U.S. is changing yearly.
    <br> </br>
    <b>Number of Electric Charging Stations</br>
    </b>
    A big factor when talking about electric vehicles are the number of charging stations across
    and other fuel alternative. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The data is available online at:
    <strong></br>
      <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/data/">Alternative Fuel Data Center: PHEV + HV Sales</br></a>
      <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/states">Alternative Fuel Data Center: Number of Stations</a>
    </strong>

  <h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>How many charging stations are there in United States?</li>
    <li>How many electric vehicles were sold in the last few years?</li>
    <li>Which car manifacture produces the most model of electric vehicles?</li>
    <li>Are there more plugin hybrid electric vehicles?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>
    I am suprised to see the number of charging stations available in other states. Living in California, I 
    see a lot of Tesla's and Nissan Leafs and had assumed that other states must have a lot of 
    electric vehicles as well. The data provided by the government website was very
    detailed and thorugh. 
  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image7.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        Using the data to calculate the total number of stations, I 
        determined which fuel alternatives are the most popular in United States. 
        There are 7 popular fuel alternatives but only one that is the most popular. As you can tell, there is a big
        difference between the top two options. Next we determine where all the electric charging stations are located.
    </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image8.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        Graph above shows the total number of electric charging stations in each state.
        I used darker shades of red to format/show which state contains the most and least electric charging stations. California sticks out
        the most having nearly four times more than the second higest state New York. Each charging station contains different amount of 
        power outlets similar to gas stations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image9.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        Using the numbers above, we can determine the average number of outlets per station. 
        For example, Texas contains an average of three outlets per station. The top five states
        with the largest number of outlets are California, New York, Florida, Texas, and Washington.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image10.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        Using the top five states from the prior graph, we can compare other fuel alternative sources by number of stations. Propane powered vehicles are more
        popular in Texas than it is in California. Texas also has more E85 stations than any other state.
        Again as you can tell from the bar grap above, California is pushing for more electric stations
        than any other state. This graph also shows the demand of electric vehicles (EV) or plugin hybrid
        electric vehicles (PHEV). 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image1.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        This bar graph represents the sales of EV and PHEV from 2011 - 2019. In six
        years, the sale of electric vehicles have eleven fold. The total number
        of electric vehicles sold including plugin hybrids is 755,176.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image2.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        In 2011 there were more electric vehicles sold than the plugin hybrid alternatives.
        There were only two times within 2011 - 2017 where the sale of PHEV passed EV sales, 
        2012 and 2013.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image6.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        The top 3 electric vehicles sold in the United States are, Chevrolet Volt, Tesla Model S, and Nissan Leaf.
        Both Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S sold above 110,000 units and the Chevrolet Volt sold 133,512 units. 
        Combining total sales for the top two EV units surpasses the top two PHEV sales.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image4.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        Here we can see the total number of PHEV sales by make and model. Chevrolet sold the 
        most unit of PHEV with 133,512 total sales. Coming far second, Toyota Prius Prime with 65,702 
        units sold, nearly half of what Volt did. 
        difference.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image5.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        Tesla Model S sold 120,821 units and coming close second, Nissan Leaf with 114,808 units sold.
        Third place goes to Tesla again with their Model X released in late 2015. In two
        years, Tesla Model X sold 41,508 units which is very impressive. From the last graph
        and this one, you can see that BMW makes the most electric vehicle.
    </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Image3.png" />
    <p class="caption">
        BMW added many electric vehicles to their linup of cars. The graph above shows
        their model name and sales number from 2011 - 2017. The model i3 sold the most with
        30,997 units. Suprisingly coming second is the SUV X5. In total BMW sold 58,517 vehicles
        in six years.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        It is important to collect data when buying an electric car. You need to consider how many charging stations
        are in your city and state. While electric vehicles still have a way to go, it definetly is the future
        and as you can tell by the number of stations and total number of electric vehicles sold, companies
        are investing big in this market.
